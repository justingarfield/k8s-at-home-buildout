## FAQ

### Why Jackett and not Prowlarr?

Prowlarr is still being very actively developed, and at the time of this writing has many major issues that Jackett does not. In favor of "something that's stable", I still use Jackett in my stack. I will most likely switch to Prowlarr down the road, but I'm still not satisfied with it yet.
