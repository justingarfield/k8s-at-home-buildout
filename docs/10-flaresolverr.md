# Flaresolverr

Flaresolverr is responsible for automatically solving Cloudflare Captchas. A lot of trackers / indexers put Cloudflare in-front of their instances now, and software like Jackett will need something like this to lean-on in-order to query those sites.

## Optional

This module is optional for this stack. Not every indexer / tracker uses Cloudflare protection. If you only have Jackett pointing to sites not using Cloudflare, then there's no reason to provision this.
